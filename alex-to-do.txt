This is Alex's current mental stack

Current stack:

* images
    - able to load/create them with their original size
    - able to load/create them with a specific size
    - able to "freeze" their size once loaded (resize will not affect them)

*  SVG images are not painted inside the cavas
    - [x] SVG in SVG rendered 
    - [x] SVG in SVG rendered as <img> (thumb)
    - network1 SVG does not scale in FF8.0 but it does in IE9
    - experimental/tango looks good but is not properly rendered

* image not working in (saved) SVG
* redraw boolean value does not seems to be really used !?!?!
* add development-rules.txt to wiki
* Text's clone not implemented ?!
* noAddUndo property must disappear
* undo of Properties and canvas (kinda finish all the undo issues)
* aproximate high degree by a "bezier path" (split it into smaller degree paths)
