Ideeas for diagramo
-------------------

* rounded connectors
* drop shadow
* connector "jump" over other connector
* fill, outline, font, etc  will have special icons
* able to upload and then reuse image per diagram
* when a connection is to be made a circle will enclose those 2 connection points
* tag for diagram, tag cloud
* request collaboration. On diagram's page an action should be present to
allow someone to ask to join editing a diagram.  Requester will fill an email and a comment.
* basic versioning added (editor, datetime and data). Plus able to restore
to a previous version
* dotted, dashed line support
* background enhancement: solid color, image, pattern
* make the connetor end in a filled arrow by default. Keep last connector
start/end in some prefferences?
