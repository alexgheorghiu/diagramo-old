Current stack:

* onMouseDown + State_NONE + group does not work
    #load diagram, click group, click empty, re-click group ==> figure selected (it should be group) :(
    Have a group of figure and another figure. Click singular figure then click a figure from group. 
    That group figure is selected instead of whole group
* grouped figures can not rotate
    onMouseMove + STATE_GROUP_SELECTED - refator accordind to Description
    onMouseDown + STATE_GROUP_SELECTED - refactor according to Description
    -- / --     + None + over a figure of a group - only that figure is selected -not the whole group :(
    deselect group             
* select 2 figures (temp group). Now you can not escape the selection
* redraw boolean value does not seems to be really used !?!?!
