Basic rules when coding in Diagramo
-----------------------------------

These are the basic rules we want to impose to ourselves when coding for Diagramo.

0. We adhere to The Zen of Python (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)
1. Anyone that work on this project to post at least an email or a phone number 
    (with hours when he can be disturbed).
2. Any commit will have a small resume that 
    describes what does the commit try to add/fix
3. We will usually integrate contribution that help in our goal. We try to avoid
    adding too many contributions that can make the application harder to use.
4. We should "Getting paid to remove features" instead of adding them.
5. Anyone that broke a build or automated tests will fix it.
