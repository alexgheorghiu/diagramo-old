This is Alex's current mental stack

Current stack:

* image make it work
    - if image scaled and then reloaded, the new size is lost (FF 4.0.1)
    - images does not show in thumbnails/myDiagrams (FF 4.0.1)
* image not working in (saved) SVG
* redraw boolean value does not seems to be really used !?!?!
* add development-rules.txt to wiki
* Text's clone not implemented ?!
* noAddUndo property must disappear
* undo of Properties and canvas (kinda finish all the undo issues)
* aproximate high degree by a "bezier path" (split it into smaller degree paths)
