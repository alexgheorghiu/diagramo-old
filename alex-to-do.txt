This is Alex's current mental stack

Current stack:

* [done]move Group, Figure  by key not working :( (working on up action)
up (in progress but command not consistent with mouse move one), down, left, right

* [x]select group, rotate it/ scale, try to move... it will rotate/scale :( (rotate handle still selected?)
* grouped figures can not rotate
    [x]onMouseMove + STATE_GROUP_SELECTED - refactor according to Description
    [x]onMouseDown + STATE_GROUP_SELECTED - refactor according to Description
    -- / --     + None + over a figure of a group - only that figure is selected -not the whole group :(
    deselect group             
* ungroup group not working
* ZOrder commands
* redraw boolean value does not seems to be really used !?!?!
