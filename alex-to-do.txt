This is Alex's current mental stack

Current stack:
It seems that if I reduce points then for very inequable segment the smoothness is not very good.
Ideas: add additional points around the "change direction" points?

Organic connectors
* NURBS for less than 4 points are not ok.....
* Export Connector as SVG not working
* End arrows must have proper directions
* thickness of connector can not be updated
* position of text should be fixed
