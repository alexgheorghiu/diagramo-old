This is Alex's current mental stack



Todo:
x save, save as, load and edit diagram
x manage users
x gave up to VERSION, WEBADRESS
x rebuild installer
x public view diagram
x on "my diagrams" logout link is broken
x fix my settings
x hide "forgot password"
x images (svg in network package) not loaded
x background of diagrams should be white (not transparent)
x write specific php.ini settings
x plug to dcentral (add version)
- update build script



Later:
SVG background of canvas
