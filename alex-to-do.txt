This is Alex's current mental stack

Current stack:

* delete command (at least for figure and group)
    if I have 2 figures from a group liked by a connector....and I deleted the group...the connector stays.....hmmm
* connectors - create action & others
* redraw boolean value does not seems to be really used !?!?!
* add development-rules.txt to wiki
