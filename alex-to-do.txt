This is Alex's current mental stack



Todo:
x save, save as, load and edit diagram
- manage users
- gave up to VERSION, WEBADRESS
- rebuild installer
- public view diagram
- on "my diagrams" logout link is broken
- fix my settings
- hide "remember me"
- images (svg in network package) not loaded
- background of diagrams should be white (not transparent)
