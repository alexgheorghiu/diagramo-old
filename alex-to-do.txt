This is Alex's current mental stack

Current stack:

* delete command (at least for figure and group)
    if I have 2 figures from a group liked by a connector....and I deleted the group...the connector stays.....hmmm
* connectors - create action & others
* [x] delete command (at least for figure and group)
* connectors 
    - [x]create action
    - [x]delete action
    - alter 
        - (in progress) connect
           --- onMouseDown  -> save connector
            |_ onMouseMove -> (done) alter it visually in real time
            |_ onMouseUp -> store undo command + state = none
        - alter path
        
* redraw boolean value does not seems to be really used !?!?!
* add development-rules.txt to wiki
* Text's clone not implemented ?!
* noAddUndo property must disappear
* undo of Properties and canvas (kinda finish all the undo issues)
