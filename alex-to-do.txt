This is Alex's current mental stack

Current stack:

* Do SVG really scale or can we use PNG at a higher resolution and scale down?
* images
    - able to load/create them with their original size
    - able to load/create them with a specific size
    - able to "freeze" their size once loaded (resize will not affect them)

*  SVG images
    - SVGs are not scaled. they behave as raster images :(
    - [x] wrong rendered in final SVG :( ONLY for Inkscape stuff
    - a rectangle with margin not properly displayed

    - [x] SVG in SVG rendered 
    - [x] SVG in SVG rendered as <img> (thumb)
    - network1 SVG does not scale in FF8.0 but it does in IE9
    - it seems SVGs made by Adobe Illustrator render fine

* basic network package (try SVG)
    - list of needed icons
        1 person [tango: system-users.svg ]
        2 switch
        3 router
        4 cloud
        5 server [tango: network-server.svg ]
        6 firewall
        7 building
        8 laptop
        9 desktop [tango]
        10 lock
        11 pda
        12 phone
        13 printer [tango]
        14 database
        15 ups
        16 wireless router [tango: network-wireless.svg ]
    - can I use Tango library?
    - extend missing icons through more Tango icons
    
    
* image not working in (saved) SVG
* redraw boolean value does not seems to be really used !?!?!
* add development-rules.txt to wiki
* Text's clone not implemented ?!
* noAddUndo property must disappear
* undo of Properties and canvas (kinda finish all the undo issues)
* aproximate high degree by a "bezier path" (split it into smaller degree paths)
