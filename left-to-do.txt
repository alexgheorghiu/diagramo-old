Current stack:

* [x]select group, rotate it/ scale, try to move... it will rotate/scale :( (rotate handle still selected?)
* grouped figures can not rotate
    [x]onMouseMove + STATE_GROUP_SELECTED - refactor according to Description
    [x]onMouseDown + STATE_GROUP_SELECTED - refactor according to Description
    -- / --     + None + over a figure of a group - only that figure is selected -not the whole group :(
    deselect group             
* ungroup group not working
* redraw boolean value does not seems to be really used !?!?!
