This is Alex's current mental stack

Current stack:

* [x] delete command (at least for figure and group)
* [x] create command (at least for figure and group)
* connectors - create action & others
* redraw boolean value does not seems to be really used !?!?!
* add development-rules.txt to wiki
* Text's clone not implemented ?!
* noAddUndo property must disappear
